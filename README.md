# TicTacThumb
A demonstration of an iOS Tic-Tac-Toe game. Not finished as of yet, but a nice demo none the less.

## Quick start
+ `git clone https://github.com/d-srd/TicTacThumb && open TicTacThumb.xcodeproj`
+ read the `ViewController.swift` class. The project is fairly short, and that class explains most of it.
